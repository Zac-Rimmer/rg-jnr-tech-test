<img src="./images/Regatta-Group-Logo.png" alt="The Regatta Group" width="250"/> <br>

<p>Thank you for speaking with us in your first interview, as mentioned in your interview as a second stage we ask you to complete a tech test that will allow us to review your coding skills.</p>
<p>For this test, we are asking that you recreate the design given within the 'test-content' folder. Within this folder you will find a design for desktop & mobile devices and also a text file with all of the text needed for this build.</p>
<p>All images for this build have been provided and can be found in the 'images' folder. Use all images provided and accurately to the given designs.</p>
<p>All CSS must be within the styles.css file.</p>

## Task List:
<ol>
    <li>Please clone this repo and once you have completed the tasks, create a pull request. We will be notified with a pull request where we will review your build and discuss our next steps. If you are unsure about cloning the repo and creating a pull request, we are happy for you to download the files and emailing your final build to Zac Rimmer - zrimmer@regatta.com</li>
    <li>From the desktop design given, build the page as accurately as possible using the images and text provided.</li>
    <li>Build the page to be fully responsive to mobile and follow the mobile design given.</li>
</ol>

## Bonus Tasks:
<p>For bonus tasks, we are asking you to use the VueJS framework. This has been linked up in the HTML file using the CDN so you don't have to worry about doing so. Any script you write needs to be setup within the index.html file rather than an external file.</p>
<p>If you are not fully comfortable using the VueJS framework, please try to complete the following bonus tasks as much as you can before submitting your final build. If you do try to complete the following tasks but don't manage to figure them out, please don't delete the code and just comment out. We will review the commented out code and can provide feedback.</p>
<ol>

    <li>Instead of inputting the press contact details in through the HTML, using VueJS write a v-for that prints out the name and contact details for the press section.</li>

    <li>Again using VueJS, below the main content of the page create 2 buttons where one increments a number and the other decrements the a number. An example of what we are looking for can be found as an image file called 'Bonus-Task' within the 'test-content' folder.</li>
    <li>As a secondary task to the above, if the counter is equal to 0 then don't show the decrement button and if the counter is equal to 10, don't show the increment button. If counter is between 1-9, both buttons should appear.</li>
</ol>

<p>We look forward to seeing your build and for any questions regarding this tech test, please directly contact Zac Rimmer - zrimmer@regatta.com<p>
