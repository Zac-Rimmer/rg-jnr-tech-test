        <h3>About Regatta</h3>
        <p>When our adventure began, there were just 12 of us. It was 1981.</p>
        <p>
          Back then the outdoors was about intrepid explorers, but we just
          wanted to open our front door and have fun. And we wanted everyone
          else out there with us too.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we made great products that people could afford, clothing to get
          them outside and enjoying the fresh air without worrying what it would
          cost. That&apos;s still what counts for us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And we&apos;re still doing it. Still thinking of new ways to help
          people, still inspired by the great outdoors and still hanging by the
          front door when you need us.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it&apos;s still what counts for the ramblers, amblers, hikers and
          bikers. campers and gardeners and daily commuters, dog walkers, show
          jumpers and multi-tasking mums, picnickers, backpackers, kids playing
          ball and dads at the footie, urban roamers and beachcombers and
          puddle-loving children and everyone else we&apos;ve helped start their
          own adventure.
        </p>

        <p>There were 12 of us</p>

        <p>Now there are millions</p>

        <p>For every adventure</p>
