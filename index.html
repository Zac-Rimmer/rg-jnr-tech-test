                <p>
                    <b>When our adventure began, there were just 12 of us. It was 1981.</b>
                    <br><br>
                    Back then the outdoors was about intrepid explorers, but we just wanted to open our
                    front door and have fun. And we wanted everyone else out there with us too.
                    <br><br>
                    So we made great products that people could afford, clothing to get them outside and
                    enjoying the fresh air without worrying what it would cost. That's still what counts
                    for us.
                    <br><br>
                    And we're still doing it. Still thinking of new ways to help people, still inspired
                    by the great outdoors and still hanging by the front door when you need us.
                    <br><br>
                    And it's still what counts for the ramblers, amblers, hikers and bikers. Campers and
                    gardeners and daily commuters, dog walkers, show jumpers and multi-tasking mums,
                    picknickers, backpackers, kids playing ball and dads at the footie, urban roamers and
                    beachcombers and puddle-loving children and everyone else we've helped start their own
                    adventure.
                    <br><br>
                    There were 12 of us
                    <br><br>
                    Now there are millions
